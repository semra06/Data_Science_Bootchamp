Data Set Information:
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership,
rental and return back has become automatic.


Bike Sharing Prediction System:
This project focuses on predicting the number of bikes rented in the upcoming hours for a bike-sharing system. The process involved extensive data exploration, feature engineering, and the development of regression models using advanced machine learning techniques, including LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.

Key steps in the project:
Data Exploration: Analyzing patterns in bike rentals based on weather conditions, time of day, and other factors.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features like day types, weather categories, and time groups to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Development: Building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to forecast bike demand.
Application: A Flask-based web application was implemented to provide real-time predictions for users or administrators.
